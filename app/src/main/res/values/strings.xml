    <string name="Entrepreneur_dialog"> This test is widely used in America to diagnose the entrepreneurial spirit.\n\n
        If a person shows some weaknesses, but retains a strong desire to own his own business and be an entrepreneur,
        then, according to the canons of entrepreneurship, this desire is quite feasible. But for this you need to select a team and your
        partners in such a way that they compensate for your weaknesses.\n For example, you do not have very high marks in "organizational
        ability" and "relationship with others". So, your team should have someone with the appropriate strengths. </string>

    <string name="test_temperament">With this test, you can easily determine whether

        To each person from
        birth is one of the four
        temperament types that change little over the course of life.\n\n

Temperament determines the strength and speed of our reactions to life events, the degree of emotionality
        personality and the degree of its nervous excitability. You cant change your temperament
        but you can learn to use not only its strong, positive, but also weak, negative, sides.\n\n

There are no people whose temperament can be 100% attributed to any particular type.\n

As a rule, our temperament is a mixture of the characteristics of two,
        and even three temperaments. Throughout life, the balance of components
        our temperament can change under the influence of events, experiences, various trials and errors.
